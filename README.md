AB testing (Independent 2 sample t-test) process

# @Author : Arda Baysallar

# CASE ****************************
Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type, 'average bidding',
as an alternative to the existing bidding type called 'maximum bidding'.
One of our clients, bombabomba.com, decided to test this new feature and
would like to do an A/B test to see if average bidding converts more than maximum bidding.
The A/B test has been going on for 1 month and bombabomba.com is now
waiting for you to analyze the results of this A/B test.
The ultimate success criterion for Bombabomba.com is Purchase.
Therefore, the focus should be on the Purchase metric for statistical testing.


# Explain Data ********************
In this data set, which includes the website information of a company,
there is information such as the number of advertisements that users see
and click, as well as earnings information from here. There are two separate
data sets, the Control and Test group. These datasets are in separate sheets
of the ab_testing.xlsx excel. Maximum Bidding was applied to the control group
and Average Bidding was applied to the test group.


### Data Features :
### impressions : Number of ad views
### Click : Number of clicks on the displayed ad
### Purchase : The number of products purchased after the ads clicked
### Earning: Earnings after purchased products
